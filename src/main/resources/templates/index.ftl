                <h1>How to Win in the ACC</h1>
                <small>May 10th, 2016</small>
                <p>The Antei Combat Center is one of the most interesting and unique things the Dark Brotherhood
                    has to offer. It can also be one of the most confusing and even intimidating things to try to
                    participate in. There are time limits. You have to take an exam to qualify, and you could end
                    up competing against people of much higher rank or who are much better known than you are. You
                    could even wind up competing against a Grand Master! It happened to me once, and it was
                    terrifying!</p>
                <p>I've been part of the ACC for many years. Way back in the day I was an Operator, I wrote a little
                    code for the site, and judged a lot of battles. In fact, I credit the ACC with inspiring me to
                    write fiction at all. Believe it or not, when I started in the Emperor's Hammer I was a gamer
                    and didn't write my first fiction until I joined the Dark Brotherhood many years later. Now
                    I don't game much at all, but writing is great fun.</p>
                <p>The best advice I can give is: Don't be afraid! The ACC is a lot of fun and can really hone your
                    writing skills. Ranks don't matter, and even as the newest Journeyman you could go up against
                    a Grand Master and conceivably win your match. You just have to write a better story than the
                    other guy. I was writing some comments on a couple ACC posts recently and got the idea to share
                    a few tips with my fellow Tarenti. Hopefully I can shed some light on ACC strategy and make it
                    easier for new writers to get started.</p>
                <p>First off, pay close attention to the nuts and bolts. The ACC is all about detail, on several
                    levels. Always get someone to read your posts, and learn to write with correct grammar. If the
                    points are close then a couple of commas or misspelled words can easily cost you a victory.
                    <strong>Don't give your opponent anything you don't have to.</strong> Stay in the past tense
                    and don't get too fancy. The ACC is about action. It's short and fast, and it's critical to
                    hold the judge's attention throughout your post.</p>
                <p>Read the rules carefully, and often. I lost a battle recently because I forgot one of the special
                    rules for the battle I was in. Had I remembered it, I probably would have won the fight.</p>
                <p>Don't Repeat Yourself. Don't reuse the same imagery or metaphors. Don't use the same way of
                    referring to the characters over and over again. Don't make all your sentences the same length.
                    Don't repeat the same word more than once in close proximity. Bust out the thesaurus if you
                    have to and look up some synonyms to avoid becoming repetitive. Don't repeat the same moves
                    in your fight scenes. If you punch them in the face, don't have them punch you in the face.
                    Try not to make your lightsaber <em>snap-hiss</em> over and over again because everyone does
                    that. Once is enough, then write something new.</p>
                <p>After you inevitably run out of things for two people beating each other up in a room to do
                    to one another, think about things that could happen outside of the two characters. Doors can
                    be opened, tunnels can collapse, the weather can change, equipment can break, and many
                    characters like to keep at least one trick up their sleeve in case of emergency. Most of the
                    venues provide opportunities for things to change during the course of the battle and the best
                    storytellers will use that to make their story much more than just two dudes hacking each others'
                    limbs off in an otherwise empty room.</p>
                <p>Think about your battle as if it were the tides in an ocean. They come in, they go out, and they
                    come in again, over and over. The cycle is a key element in any story but it can be extremely
                    helpful in the ACC. The interesting parts of the story are the ones where the balance of power
                    is shifting. The way your character swings her lightsaber isn't all that interesting since we
                    can't see it. When she exploits her opponent's weakness and gains the upper hand, there is a
                    ton of visual, audio, and emotional stuff going on to write about. When she slips up and has to
                    go on the defensive, that's also interesting. How does she respond to that? What does she do?
                    What does her opponent do? I usually try to shift the balance an odd number of times in a post,
                    so that the character who was at an advantage at the start is at a disadvantage by the end of
                    the post. If you believe Sun Tzu there are no constant conditions in battle, so to write an
                    action sequence you should always be focused on how the situation is changing.</p>
                <p>Especially when you're going up against newer ACCers, write long posts. Don't stop at the 250
                    word minimum. A long post is instantly intimidating. People often assume your writing is good
                    if you write a longer post. Additionally, consistency is one of the key factors you are graded
                    on; if you write a long post you can bury a lot of details in it that your opponent will have
                    to remember and factor into his own post. Piling on a ton of detail can actually increase the
                    chances of your opponent making a fatal mistake.</p>
                <p>Research your opponent's character very carefully. Read their previous posts. Check out their
                    wiki if they have one. Read their character sheet carefully. Try to get a strong sense of who
                    this character really is. It's important for writing a great story that you make each character
                    stand out as unique and different. It's also easier to write about a character if you know
                    them pretty well.</p>
                <p><strong>You do not have to kill the other guy.</strong> This is probably the hardest thing to
                    learn about the ACC. Everybody goes in wanting their character to survive the fight, but in
                    a lot of cases that just isn't how it's going to turn out. If it makes more sense for the other
                    guy to kill you, then go ahead and write it that way. Having your character die at the end will
                    not hurt your chances of winning at all, as long as you're sticking to what would "realistically"
                    happen.</p>
                <p>Think carefully about where you end your posts. If you were your opponent and had to continue from
                    the end of your post, what would you write? It's less about your characters and more about leaving
                    the other writer in a tough position. I've had good success with two strategies. One is to not give
                    them any hints and leave everything as wide open as you can at the end of your post. That makes the
                    other guy start with nothing and have to add new things to the story to make it interesting. For
                    some people that is difficult. The other way is to pigeonhole the other guy so that there is really
                    only one thing they can write about. I had a battle with Halc where he pulled this off really well
                    by having a cave collapse and trap me inside, away from him. Stuck alone in the dark is a really
                    hard place to start writing an interesting story from since there aren't that many options as to
                    what you can write about. When you're new to the ACC and the DB it can be tough to know enough
                    about your opponent to psyche them out, but you'll start to get a feel for it if you take the time
                    to do your research, especially in your second post.</p>
                <p>It's a pretty cheap trick, but think about timing. ACC posts are timed and timeouts happen
                    all too frequently. Don't wait until the last minute to write your post. Find out what timezone
                    your opponent lives in and try to post your post to maximize the number of his hours will be
                    spent sleeping and at work/school. The advantage you'll gain from doing this is tiny and it's
                    never a sure thing, but the less time your opponent has to get the writing and editing done, the
                    better your chance is that his writing won't be good. Always play by the rules, but make the best
                    possible use of all the resources you have to play with.</p>
                <p>That's all the advice I've got for you for now. Hopefully it gives you some things to think about
                    when you write your next ACC post and will help you get an edge over opponents from other Clans.
                    The ACC is a lot of fun and can be very challenging, but it's not something to be afraid of. Just
                    jump in and write. Get help from your friends and mentors to improve your writing. If you practice
                    you will improve.</p>
